Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software system.
The importance of a technology industry enabling craetion of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life . 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design-creating high level and detailed design of software architecture and userinterface
3. Implementation-building software and writing code accordind to design specification
4. testing-doing various test to ensure software meets quality standardsand functional requirements.
5. Deployment-releasing software to users
6. Maintenanace-Providing ongoing support ,updates and enhancements to softawareafter deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach approach thathas distinct phases flowing downwards like requirements , design,implementation ,testing, deployment ,maintenanace while Agile methodology is an iterative  and incremental approach focused on flexibility collaborationa and responding to change like requirement,implementation,design, deployment, testing, maintenanace.                                                                    
 
 Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Softwrare developer-responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test planes.
Project manager-oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 1.Intergrated  Development  Environment It is a  software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing codes example visual studio,eclipse. 
2.Version Control systems it is a software tool for tracking changes to source code and cordinating work among  team memebers. example suberversion and GIT
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Tight deadlines.
2.changing requirementduring development cycle leading to scope creep and project delay.
3.Technical debt.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing-testing individual components of softwar.
2.INTERGRATION TESTING -testing interacction betwween different components.
3.System testing-testing entire software system as a whole.
4.Acceptance-testindg software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is giving instructions to AI to d something by writing set of commands.
Its importance is it makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in first prompt.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
prompt to Copilot(Create a picture of people inthe market buying and selling vegatables, fruits, cereals and clothes) The prompt is effective because it stating that i ned a picture of what and where and doing what  with which goods)
